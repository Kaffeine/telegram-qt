TelegramQt Server
=======================

TelegramQt-based Telegram Server

This server is developed to test a Telegram client without bothering the official server.

There is also no intention to make it a "production-ready" server and though it runs as
a cluster there is no purpose to make it scalable or performant.

Key Generation
==============

    mkdir ~/TelegramServer
    cd ~/TelegramServer
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
    openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
    openssl rsa -pubin -in public_key.pem -RSAPublicKey_out > public_key_PKCS1.pem
